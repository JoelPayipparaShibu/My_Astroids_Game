# My_Astroids_Game
Asteroids is a thrilling space adventure game developed as part of a grade 11 project using object-oriented programming. The game puts players in the role of a spaceship pilot tasked with navigating through a field of asteroids while avoiding collisions. 

The game was developed to practice using classes and objects to get more familiar with them for my future adventures. The game is comprised of 3 different classes called Astroid, Ship and Bullets respectively. The Astroid class has 2 different child classes called Astroid_A and Astroid_B respectively to create instances of two different looking astroids that have defferent looks and points to make the game a bit more interesting. The smaller astroid gives 10 points where as the bigger ones have to be hit twice to be destroid and gives 10 points each hit.

The game also utilises collision algorithm to register when the astroid collids with the space ship or the bullets.
